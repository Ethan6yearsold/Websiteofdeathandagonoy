<h2> don't mess with the Bob...or you will get the house</h2>
<p> I love to go shopping! shop shop shop! shoes and purse! :D</p>
<p>Mark grew up with his younger sister Devon. The two shared a close bond that continued into adulthood.</p>
<p>While working at Ganz College, Mark met Gemma when they were both donating blood. They started seeing each other and eventually married. Their marriage was happy, but was strained after a miscarriage and subsequent infertility. Then one night, Gemma left to go to a work event while Mark stayed behind to finish something for work. Cops came to Mark's house that night to tell him Gemma had died in a car accident.[3]</p>
    
<p>Mark S. was first a Senior Macrodata Refiner and was promoted to Macrodata Refinement Chief following his coworker Petey's departure. He was shocked when he learned he was being promoted because Petey no longer worked there, but quickly stepped into Petey's shoes, training his replacement: Helly R. Helly was combative during her training, even throwing a speaker at Mark's head. Mark ended up going off-script to talk about waking up after his own procedure. After Helly asked to leave three times, Mark took her to a stairwell, but every time she left, she found herself back there again. He told her it was because she chose to come back. When she gave up trying to leave, he took her to Cobel's office. While Milchick bandaged his forehead, Cobel talked to Helly about her behavior and gave her the disk that contained the last part of her training. Mark then went to talk to Cobel himself. She was upset with him for going off-script and told him his department could be good or bad and it came down to the people in it.</p>

<h2> now back to what I was saying</h2>
<p>Mark went back to MDR, where Helly was finishing her training. After she was done, she asked if they ever got to leave. He said they did, but she knew it wouldn't feel like they left because the next thing they knew, they'd be back there. When she asked about having a choice, he told her that every time she found herself there, it was because a version of her chose to come there.</p>
<p>When Mark left work, he found a gift card and a note saying he'd hit his head on an overhead projector slide. As he drove home, he nearly hit Helly with his car, though they didn't recognize each other. Mark then drove home and the next day, Devon came to pick him up for a food-less dinner with Ricken and his friends. The conversation quickly turned to Mark's work as a history professor and then his work at Lumon and him being severed. The conversation got testy, but then Ricken settled things by saying he stood behind Mark despite the controversy.</p>
    
<p>After the guests left, Devon made Mark a sandwich and tried to buy his forgiveness. Then she insisted he stay the night, which meant sleeping in their expected baby's room. Mark struggled to sleep and got up to get water in the middle of the night. He saw a man standing in Devon's yard, but the man disappeared when a car went back. In the morning, Mark told Devon about the man and she said it was probably a stumbler from a nearby bar.</p>
